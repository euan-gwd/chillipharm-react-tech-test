# ChilliBean React Tech Test

Welcome to the ChilliBean React tech test.

## Background

ChilliBean's main product is a service called ChilliPharm - which is like Google Drive for pharmaceutical files (primarily videos).  An uploaded file (most often a video, but sometimes images or documents) is called an "asset". A key part of the system is the ability to attach metadata to assets, a tagging system similar to photo tagging on sites like Facebook or Instagram.

## Task

Create a small React application that displays a set of assets (static images for simplicity) and their tags.  Users should be able to add, reorder and delete tags from existing assets. Tag order is not significant for any other part of the functionality in this example. Tags should be suggested from the provided data set where possible.

The displayed set of assets should also be filterable by any combination of user provided tags.

As a frontend task, the focus is less on the engineering complexity, and more on the UI and interactivity of the task.

## Resources

An initial data set is provided for you in `data.json`, as an example of the kind of data you could receive from a backend ChilliPharm service.

You can see an example of a finished application that meets the spec hosted here: https://chillibean.github.io/react-tech-test/

## Timeframe

The task should take about 2.5 to 3 hours to complete. If it is taking longer, stop and submit your work.  Getting all the way through the task is less important than evidence of good working process and software development.

## Notes

* Use of React Hooks over Class components is preferred, but not essential if you're not familiar with them yet.
* Use any libraries or packages you like to assist your solution.

## Submission

Upload your solution to a private Github repository, add user `jasonsof` (https://github.com/jasonsof) as a collaborator, then email the link to `jason@chillibean.com`.
